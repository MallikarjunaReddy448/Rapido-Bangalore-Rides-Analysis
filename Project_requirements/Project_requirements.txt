## **Business Requirements for the Rapido Project**

### **1. SQL Tasks (Data Extraction & Analysis)**
#### **Basic:**
1. Count the total number of rides and completed rides.
2. Retrieve unique ride services (`services`) and their total ride count.
3. Identify the most frequently used payment method.
4. Extract rides where `ride_charge` is greater than `total_fare` (possible data error check).
5. Find the average ride duration by service type.

#### **Intermediate:**
6. Identify the busiest day of the week for rides.
7. Calculate total revenue per month.
8. Find the top 5 most common source-destination pairs.
9. Calculate the percentage of rides canceled vs. completed.
10. Identify peak ride hours by analyzing `time` column.

#### **Advanced:**
11. Find the longest ride in terms of both **distance** and **duration**.
12. Analyze fare pricing trends by **distance categories** (0-5km, 5-10km, etc.).
13. Rank **source-destination** pairs by revenue using window functions.
14. Compare revenue share of different **service types**.
15. Create a stored procedure to fetch ride details for a given date range.
16. Identify **low-revenue rides** (low distance, low fare).
17. Find seasonal ride trends (compare summer vs. winter).
18. Analyze rides with **high misc charges** (potential service issues).
19. Detect duplicate ride IDs if any.
20. Create a **revenue forecasting table** using historical ride data.

### **2. Python Tasks (Data Cleaning & Predictive Analysis)**
#### **Basic:**
1. Load the dataset and check for missing values.
2. Convert `date` and `time` columns into **proper datetime format**.
3. Identify most common ride sources and destinations.
4. Compute basic ride statistics (mean, median, std of fare, duration, distance).
5. Create a histogram of ride durations.

#### **Intermediate:**
6. Identify and handle outliers in `total_fare` and `duration`.
7. Analyze **customer behavior trends** (frequent source-destination pairs).
8. Perform correlation analysis between **distance, duration, and total fare**.
9. Generate a **time-series plot** for daily revenue trends.
10. Compare ride patterns between weekdays and weekends.

#### **Advanced:**
11. Build a **predictive model** for estimating `total_fare` based on distance, duration, and service type.
12. Use clustering (K-Means) to classify source and destination hubs.
13. Detect anomalies in ride pricing using **Isolation Forest or Z-score analysis**.
14. Create a **ride cancellation prediction model** based on past trends.
15. Develop an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit or Dash**.
16. Perform **seasonal decomposition** to analyze ride trends over time.
17. Use NLP (if user reviews exist) to analyze customer feedback.
18. Build a **customer segmentation model** based on ride patterns.
19. Automate data reporting using Python and schedule reports.
20. Forecast future revenue using **ARIMA or Prophet models**.

### **3. Tableau/Power BI Tasks (Dashboard & Visualizations)**
#### **Basic:**
1. Create a **bar chart** showing revenue by service type.
2. Develop a **pie chart** for ride status distribution.
3. Visualize **payment method usage** with a **donut chart**.
4. Create a **heatmap** for source-destination ride frequency.
5. Build a **line chart** for monthly revenue trends.

#### **Intermediate:**
6. Develop a **dual-axis chart** comparing daily ride counts vs. revenue.
7. Create a **geographical heatmap** showing ride demand across cities.
8. Implement a **ride cancellation rate dashboard**.
9. Build a **filterable KPI dashboard** (total rides, revenue, cancellations).
10. Create a **scatter plot** for distance vs. total fare.

#### **Advanced:**
11. Build a **dynamic dashboard** with a **time selection parameter** (daily, monthly, yearly).
12. Use **Level of Detail (LOD) calculations** to compare **revenue per ride**.
13. Create a **Sankey diagram** for source-to-destination analysis.
14. Develop a **profitability forecast** using Power BI's forecasting tools.
15. Use clustering in Tableau to identify high-demand areas.
16. Create an **advanced ride fare comparison dashboard** (by service type, region, etc.).
17. Implement a **drill-down feature** for analyzing individual rides.
18. Use **trend lines** and moving averages for revenue analysis.
19. Develop an **interactive parameter-based report** in Power BI.
20. Apply **AI-driven insights in Power BI** to detect anomalies in ride data.

### **4. Excel Tasks (Data Cleaning, Reporting & Analysis)**
#### **Basic:**
1. Use conditional formatting to highlight **high fare rides**.
2. Create a pivot table to summarize **total revenue by service type**.
3. Calculate **average ride duration** using Excel functions.
4. Extract day, month, and year from the `date` column using `TEXT()` function.
5. Filter **only completed rides** using an advanced filter.
